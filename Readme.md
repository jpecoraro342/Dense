## Dense - Calorie Counter
The calorie counting app for the ultralight backpacker

Dense is designed for the most intense gram weenies, who not only need their gear to be ultralight, but also need their food to be ultralight. Scan barcodes of any food item to input the calories and weight into your resupply. Dense will then do all the heavy lifting, and tell you exactly how heavy your food is, and how calorie dense it is. Optimize your resupply by removing anything that isn't dense enough for you.

**Coming Soon**

- [ ] Set target calories/day, and show how many days of food you have in your resupply
- [ ] Quickly start a new resupply by adding items you've previously used
- [ ] Save a history of your resupplies so you can see what you had last time
- [ ] Update open food facts api from directly within the app
- [ ] Dev mode to manage all the data stored locally on your device
- [ ] Macro tracking

**API Info**

Dense uses the api at [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) to fetch nutrition information from barcodes. As this API is based on user submitted data, information may be missing or incomplete. You can help the open food facts initiative by updating data at [the open food facts website](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/help-complete-products) or with the [open food facts app.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/open-food-facts-product-scan/id588797948)
